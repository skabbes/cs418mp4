The block I is a particle system with damping with gravity and wind (so
that the I falls over), shown over a cubic bezier curve meant to 
follow the I's path to the ground.

To compile the code, simply run make, to run execute ./mp4.

Also, there are some options to visualize the springs
    'n' -> returns the simulation to normal mode
    'b' -> visualizes the springs as balls
    's' -> visualizes the springs with various colored lines
           based on how much that spring is compressed or stretched
